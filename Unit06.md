**Unit 6: A Post-Colonial World and Voices From the Margins** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, we have seen the decline of Empire and
the emergence of a new, post-colonial world order.  How did these
sweeping changes impact the literary landscape of the Modern Period?  In
this unit, we will examine the legacy of colonization and the emergence
of new voices capable of re-writing history and re-defining the destiny
and cultural significance of English literature.  In the process, we
will pay particular attention to the ways in which former subjects have
negotiated with English literary conventions in order to “make it new”
once more.*
