From Friedrich Nietzsche’s shocking pronouncement in the late 1800s that
“God is dead” and that “we have killed him” to Vladimir Nabokov’s
convention-challenging fiction, the Modern period—spanning roughly the
end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century to the present—offered a range of
provocative and often cynical cultural and literary productions.  In
this course, we will work to develop a more nuanced understanding of the
scope of cultural and literary expression in the late 19<sup>th</sup>
and the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and a working
definition of what the vacuous-sounding term “modernism” might mean.  We
will attend to broad socio-historical happenings, from the birth of
modernism in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century to the radical violence of
the World Wars and the tragedy of the Holocaust and arrive at the
post-modern moment, our post-colonial and technologically and
economically globalized village.  While offering this historical
context, the course focuses on the cultural and literary movements from
the “art for art’s sake” decadence of the late 1800s to the avant-garde
experiments of the post-war period and beyond. In addition to literary
“modernism,” the course will also take a brief look at the cultural
production of “modernism” in art, music, architecture, cinema,
philosophy, and drama. Yet, while the course will generally navigate
late 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century literature in the
British tradition, framed by historical understanding and infused with
an investigation of concomitant cultural production, we will end by
briefly examining the increasingly global nature of postmodern culture,
encountering the texts (and contexts) of Anglophone authors as diverse
as India’s Arundhati Roy and Nigeria’s Chinua Achebe as well as taking a
brief look at globalized, contemporary art and literature. Therefore, by
the end of this course, we should have an advanced conceptualization of
“modernism” and its many varied constructions, the major literary trends
and cultural achievements of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and
20<sup>th</sup> centuries, and the socio-historical movements that
shaped them, as well as an attentiveness to the impact that
globalization currently has upon literature and cultural production.
