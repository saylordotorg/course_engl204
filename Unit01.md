**Unit 1: The Turn of the Century** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will start by situating ourselves in the late 1800s, taking stock of
the various social changes and artistic trends that were beginning to
challenge predominant 19<sup>th</sup>-century assumptions, values, and
social configurations.  It may seem strange to begin this course in
Fin-de-Siècle Paris, but, as we will see, much of the art and literature
produced in late-1800s France would lay the foundation for
20<sup>th</sup>-century innovations in English poetry and literature. 
We will also account for those voices that continued to promote the
old-guard imperialist views and Victorian values so inherent to
mainstream British literature of the 1800s.  *
