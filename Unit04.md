**Unit 4: High Modernist Aesthetics** <span id="4"></span> 
*Drawing from our exposure to the high modernist techniques of Virginia
Woolf’s* To the Lighthouse*, we will work on honing our definition of
modernism and one of its most prominent iterations – High Modernism – by
identifying some of its characteristic features.  In this unit, we will
take on one of the most revered (and feared) geniuses of the
20<sup>th</sup> century, James Joyce, studying his thematic, stylistic,
and formal choices and relating them to other 20<sup>th</sup> century
trends we’ve seen thus far.*
