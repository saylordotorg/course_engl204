**Unit 5: The Shift to Post-Modernism** <span id="5"></span> 
*Now that we have a better grasp of “modernism,” we will attempt to
identify and evaluate the distinctive features of a new literary moment:
 the post-modern.  How does “post-modernism” differ from “modernism,”
and what concerns do they share?  As we move through some of the most
provocative and challenging works of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in this
unit, we will situate the post-modernist’s poetics within the Modern
Period and its ever-evolving understanding of the relationship between
representation and reality.*
