**Unit 2: The Outbreak of War** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will acquaint ourselves with the historical and social
contexts of World War I and then explore the ways in which literary
forms developed to make sense of the unanticipated violence and
destruction of the first mass war of the 20<sup>th</sup> century as well
as the seeming loss of the old European order.  We will compare and
contrast the varied poems of this period, identifying their affiliations
with certain traditions and their experimentation with new styles and
themes, paying particular attention to the ways in which poets used the
genre to process the violence of war.*
