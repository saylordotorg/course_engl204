**Unit 3: Post-War Disillusion and "The Lost Generation"** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In the post-war years, nothing seemed certain:  the old stabilities of
empire, religion, and shared social mores seem to have been swept away
by the war.  In this unit, we will trace the emergence of new literary
forms and styles as authors attempted to come to terms with the seeming
chaos and disorder of the 1920s, from the disorienting juxtaposition and
dense allusiveness of poetry by T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound to the intense
stream-of-consciousness and temporal complexity of Virginia Woolf’s* To
the Lighthouse*.  Along the way, we will take a look at the era’s
culture of excess and exile, typified by the famous expatriate circle
that settled in Paris in the 1920s and included such prominent figures
as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein.  *
